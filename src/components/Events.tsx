          Event Description:
          <br />
          Step right up to Brain-O-Val Conquere, where the thrill of a carnival
          meets the excitement of trivia! Teams will compete in a lively,
          action-packed contest where knowledge, speed, and strategy take center
          stage. With carnival-inspired challenges and a festive atmosphere, get
          ready to stack, build, and block your way to victory in two
          electrifying rounds of technical trivia!
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>PARTICIPATION</strong>
          <br />
          Team Size: Maximum of 3 members and minimum of 2 members per team.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>ROUNDS</strong>
          <br />
          <strong>Round 1: Stack & Answer Spectacle</strong>
          <br />
          Challenge: In this carnival-style showdown, teams will face a series
          of trivia questions displayed on the screen. But thereâ€™s a
          twistâ€”before answering, teams must stack cups in a specific pattern,
          just like a carnival game challenge! The pattern will be displayed
          before each question for 15 sec. The team should memorize the pattern
          in the given time and try to replicate it. The first team to
          successfully stack the cups in the correct pattern earns the chance to
          answer the question.
          <br />
          Advancement: The teams with the most points will advance to the grand
          finale.
          <br />
          Objective: Stack your cups, be the first to buzz in, and score big
          points!
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Round 2: Build or Bust Bonanza</strong>
          <br />
          Challenge: The top 4 teams advance to this thrilling final round. In
          this round, answering questions correctly allows teams to build their
          own carnival blocks. If answered wrong, the team has to step one block
          down from their tower. But the fun doesnâ€™t stop thereâ€”teams can also
          use their points to destroy an opponentâ€™s blocks, adding a strategic
          twist to the carnival chaos! Every correct answer either builds your
          structure or knocks down your rivalsâ€™ towers.
          <br />
          Objective: Be the first team to build all four blocks and stand
          victorious as the champions of the Brain-o-Val!
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Event Rules:</strong>
          <br />
          - Teams must consist of up to 2-3 members.
          <br />
          - In Round 1, teams must stack cups according to the carnival-inspired
          pattern shown on the screen before each trivia question.
          <br />
          - In Round 2, correct answers will allow teams to either build their
          blocks or bust their opponentsâ€™ blocks. A wrong answer will destroy
          their own block.
          <br />
          - The first team to complete the stacking pattern gets the first
          opportunity to answer.
          <br />
          - The decisions of the quizmaster and event coordinators are final;
          arguments are strictly prohibited. If violated, immediate
          disqualification of the respective team will be executed!
          <br />
          - Tiebreaker: In case of a tie, the first team to answer correctly
          will take home the grand prize.
